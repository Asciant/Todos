## How do I run it (only as a development build)

_There are no built packages available, they won't be compiled as platform installers until the 1.0.0 release._

We will assume that you have node, npm and yarn installed as a minimum.

First, clone the repo into an empty folder:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Asciant/Todos.git
```

And then install the dependencies with yarn:

```bash
$ cd Todos
$ yarn
```

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hmr-react/) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

If you don't need autofocus when your files was changed, then run `dev` with env `START_MINIMIZED=true`:

```bash
$ START_MINIMIZED=true yarn dev
```
